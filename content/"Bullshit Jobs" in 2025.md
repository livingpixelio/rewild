I just finished David Graeber's 2018 book "Bullshit Jobs", based on his 2013 essay [On the Phenomenon of Bullshit Jobs](https://davidgraeber.org/articles/on-the-phenomenon-of-bullshit-jobs-a-work-rant/). The essay at the time apparently caused a bit of a sensation, including an attempted rebuttal from *The Economist,* and several polls were conducted to find out the extent to which Graeber was correct.
The key paragraph is this:
> While corporations may engage in ruthless downsizing, the layoffs and speed-ups invariably fall on that class of people who are actually making, moving, fixing and maintaining things; through some strange alchemy no one can quite explain, the number of salaried paper-pushers ultimately seems to expand, and more and more employees find themselves, not unlike Soviet workers actually, working 40 or even 50 hour weeks on paper, but effectively working 15 hours just as Keynes predicted, since the rest of their time is spent organizing or attending motivational seminars, updating their facebook profiles or downloading TV box-sets.

While Graeber is careful to point out that *he* cannot decide which jobs are bullshit and which are not, there are a startling number of people who think *their own* jobs are bullshit. His arguments rests of believing them, and makes a convincing case that we should. The limitation of the essay at the time was he didn't have real data: he had to rely on anecdotal accounts by bullshit-job holders. By the time the book was published, surveys had been conducted that show pretty robustly that roughly 40%-50% of the population of both the US and UK believe that their own jobs should not exist.
I don't want to discuss here whether Graeber is *right.* That argument seems to have been going on since 2013, and I doubt anyone is going to change their mind based on what I say. What I would like to do is think about two big narratives about work in the 2020s, and how the "bullshit jobs" thesis might inform what people are writing and saying about them.

## Remote work, hybrid work, and return to office

"Bullshit Jobs" was published in 2018. Two years later, nearly everyone who had a bullshit job had to leave the office, and work via email, Slack, and Zoom. As the pandemic subsided, *most* white-collar workers did not return to the office full-time; instead, *most* of them can now do their jobs in some kind of hybrid work arrangement, and (especially in tech) lots and lots of workers are fully remote.
*Why* workers partly won a battle against their managers for the first time in decades over this one specific issue is a bit of a mystery. Cal Newport has argued that the pandemic simply reversed the collective action problem as it usually exists: since workers were already home, employers who demanded their return-to-office were faced with the loss of enough of their workforce that they blinked, and a combination of hiring and people moving during the pandemic meant that there were plenty of workers who could not return, even if they wanted to.
